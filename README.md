    API for online shop which sells different types of products (like e.g Amazon). I've had implement functionality for managing carts, creating orders and products. User can add some products to the cart and then order them. Information about products can show as a single product or all products. Products data can be changed by authentication user. User has opportunity to login or create new user. For having access to carts or products user must have JWT token /api/auth/login (example 
    Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9. eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiMDVjMzJhMWQtMjkyZC00Yjg5LWJjYTgtYzNjNzEyMWE0NWEwIiwiZW1haWwiOiJhbmZpc2Euam9uZXNAZXBhbS5jb20iLCJyb2xlIjoidXNlciIsImlhdCI6MTczMjcyNTAyMywiZXhwIjoxNzMyNzMyMfIzfQ.i-_6ml4g3YVbWoWmALw0JylhvG_RR8AAsggNtNEPd2E)

    User can use internal relational databases by takeing podman-compose.yml and using podman or create his own model by using .env file.
